 Realtime Sign Language Detection and Recognition using Mediapipe

It aims to detect and recognize sign language actions through
the key points of hands. We captured the key points using Mediapipe

We deployed our project as a Web application using Flask.

Technologies- Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Tensorflow, Flask.
