# Realtime Sign Language Detection and Recognition

This project focuses on the fascinating task of detecting and recognizing sign language actions through the precise key points of hand movements. 
Leveraging the powerful Mediapipe Library, we meticulously captured these key points, stored them in an array, and trained a sophisticated model on this data. 
To make our work accessible and interactive, we deployed the project as a sleek web application using Flask.

Technologies- Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Tensorflow, Flask.

This project was done in Group as a Project Evaluation for the CDAC e-DAI Course.
